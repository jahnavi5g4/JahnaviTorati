### Hi Developers 👋

I'm
Trainee Software Engineer.
The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (Python), design (working closely with designers), front-end development (Angular9, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX), database(Mysql)
